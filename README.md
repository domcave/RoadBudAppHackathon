# RoadBudAppHackathon
Companion car app. Created by our group during the 2023 Steelhacks Hackathon event. 

## Project
This project is meant to be a prototype of an app that would be the user's car maintenance companion app. The user would first register their car's make and model, and the app would then track how long until the car's next maintenance of things like oil changes, tire rotations, air filter changes, etc. When that certain number of miles has been driven, the app sends an alert.

Ideally, in the future, the app would connect directly to the car to track these things (we used a step counter just to show off functionality). It would also hopefully provide step-by-step help to the user in how to do some of this basic maintenance.

## How to Use
Go to the [RoadBudZip](https://github.com/domcave/RoadBudZip) repository and follow the directions there.
